        “Working with Janine during my career change was truly life-changing. We looked holistically at all areas of my life, including my skills, health, and work and life experience, which helped me realise I have autonomy and far more options than I ever thought.
        <br><br>
        Janine is an excellent life coach and career coach. I now know what I want in life and no longer feel stuck. I have a new CV, feel confident in how to job search effectively, and have already been applying for roles. I also have an interview coming up, which Janine has helped me prepare for.
        <br><br>
        All of this in just six sessions. I would highly recommend her.”
