    <h2>üì© Follow Up Applications</h2>

    <p><strong>Why following up matters:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shows enthusiasm:</strong> A polite follow-up signals you‚Äôre genuinely interested in the role.</li>
      <li><strong>Keeps your name visible:</strong> It reminds hiring teams who you are.</li>
      <li><strong>Demonstrates initiative:</strong> Employers value proactive candidates.</li>
      <li><strong>Catches missed applications:</strong> You may catch a delay or error.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to follow up effectively:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Email (preferred):</strong> Send a short, polite email 3‚Äì5 days after the deadline:</p>

Subject: Follow-Up on [Job Title] Application

Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],

I hope you're well. I recently applied for the [Job Title] role and wanted to follow up to confirm you received my application. I'm still very interested in the position and would love the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Please let me know if there‚Äôs anything else I can provide.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
    </pre>

    <p><strong>Phone (optional):</strong> If there's a contact number:</p>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm just following up on my application for [Job Title]. I wanted to confirm it was received and to express my continued interest.‚Äù
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Things to avoid:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Following up too early (before the deadline)</li>
      <li>Sounding impatient or pushy</li>
      <li>Generic messages like "To whom it may concern"</li>
      <li>Following up more than once unless invited</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Following up doesn‚Äôt just keep your application top of mind ‚Äî it shows confidence, communication skills, and interest. Keep it polite and professional, and it can really pay off.</p>
