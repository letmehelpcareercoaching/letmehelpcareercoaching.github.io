    <h2>üì¨ Follow Up Applications</h2>

    <p>Following up on a job application can give you a real edge. Here's why it matters and how to do it professionally:</p>

    <h3>‚úÖ Why Following Up Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>üì£ Shows Enthusiasm:</strong> Employers want to hire people who are genuinely interested.</li>
      <li><strong>üëÄ Keeps You Visible:</strong> A quick follow-up helps you stand out among other candidates.</li>
      <li><strong>‚ö° Demonstrates Initiative:</strong> Being proactive is a quality many employers value.</li>
      <li><strong>üõ† Catches Mistakes:</strong> If your application went missing, a follow-up can save it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>‚úâÔ∏è How to Follow Up</h3>
    <p>Email is usually best ‚Äî here‚Äôs a professional example:</p>

    <pre><code>Subject: Follow-Up on Marketing Assistant Application

Dear Ms. Patel,

I hope you're well. I recently applied for the Marketing Assistant role and wanted to follow up to confirm you received my application.

I'm still very interested in the position and would love the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide.

Best regards,  
Sam Turner</code></pre>

    <p>You can also make a polite phone call if a number is listed. Just keep it short, friendly, and confident.</p>

    <h3>üö´ Avoid These Mistakes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Too early:</strong> Don‚Äôt follow up before the deadline.</li>
      <li><strong>Pushy tone:</strong> Stay polite and respectful.</li>
      <li><strong>No personalisation:</strong> Avoid ‚ÄúTo whom it may concern.‚Äù</li>
      <li><strong>Too many follow-ups:</strong> One message is usually enough.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Done well, a follow-up shows confidence and professionalism ‚Äî two things every employer appreciates!</p>
