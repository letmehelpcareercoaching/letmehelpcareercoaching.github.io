    <h2>üîç Get Your Name Noticed</h2>

    <p><strong>1. Research the employer.</strong> Find the job on their website and apply directly there if possible.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Make contact before applying.</strong> Find a question to ask about the role and call the recruiter or hiring manager. Be friendly, ask your question, and give your name clearly.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Follow up after applying.</strong> Ask for an email address to confirm they‚Äôve received your application ‚Äî or send your CV and cover letter directly to them if appropriate.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Be proactive with communication.</strong> After sending your application, follow up once to check it was received. Use names where possible.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Make a follow-up call.</strong> After the application deadline, make a polite follow-up call to ask about the status of your application.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Stay professional throughout.</strong> Smile on the phone (people can hear it!). Make notes after each call and remember names of those you speak with.</p>

    <p>These small actions help you stand out in a crowded job market. Employers appreciate polite, proactive candidates ‚Äî so don‚Äôt be afraid to get your name out there!</p>
