    <h2>About Me â€“ Janine Conway</h2>

    <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Janine â€“ founder of Let Me Help Career and Life Coaching. I have over 20 years of experience supporting people to navigate life and work challenges, and Iâ€™m passionate about helping others make sustainable, positive changes.</p>

    <p>My academic background includes A-levels in Psychology and Law, a BSc degree in Criminology and Sociology, and a Level 3 qualification in Coaching and Mentoring. Iâ€™m also currently in the final year of a Level 4 Diploma in Therapeutic Counselling and am due to qualify in June 2026. As part of my training, Iâ€™m currently practicing as a student counsellor with MIND â€” an experience I find deeply rewarding and enriching.</p>

    <p>My professional journey began in hospitality before I transitioned to working with young people who found mainstream education challenging. Iâ€™ve since worked with individuals of all ages â€” including those with mental health difficulties, disabilities, and people navigating career transitions â€” helping them develop life skills, explore new paths, and build confidence and self-belief.</p>

    <p>Let Me Help Career and Life Coaching is my way of reaching out to a wider audience, offering thoughtful, client-focused support that looks at the whole person â€” not just their work or CV. I work collaboratively with clients, helping them set meaningful goals and guiding them through each step of the journey.</p>

    <p>People often tell me Iâ€™m easy to talk to and have a very calming, welcoming presence. Whether itâ€™s a manager, client, or someone Iâ€™ve just met â€” Iâ€™ve consistently been told Iâ€™m extremely good at what I do. I genuinely care about the people I work with, and itâ€™s my mission to support them with insight, compassion, and a sense of purpose.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m based in Ramsbottom, Bury, and offer face-to-face sessions across Greater Manchester. I also work online, so I can support clients from anywhere in the UK.</p>
