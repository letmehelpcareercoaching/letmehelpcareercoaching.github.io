    <h2>About Me â€“ Janine Conway</h2>
    <p>My name is Janine Conway. My educational background includes A-levels in Psychology and Law, followed by a BSc degree in Criminology and Sociology. Iâ€™ve been studying Counselling for the last four years and am now in my final year of a Level 4 Diploma, due to qualify as a counsellor in June 2026.</p>

    <p>My career began in the hospitality industry until 2002. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked extensively with young people who found traditional schooling unsuitable. I supported them in personal and social development, taught functional skills, and helped them access traineeships and placements in industries that matched their interests.</p>

    <p>For over 20 years, Iâ€™ve worked as a career and life coach with young people and adults â€” including those with physical and mental health challenges â€” helping them gain confidence, skills, and direction. I focus on enabling sustainable change by addressing life, work, health, and wellbeing holistically, and supporting my clients through each step of their journey.</p>

    <p>Let Me Help Career and Life Coaching is my way of offering these services to the wider community. Iâ€™m currently a student counsellor with MIND, where Iâ€™m deepening my skills and gaining valuable experience. The tools and insights Iâ€™m learning have transformed the way I support people â€” with deeper listening, more meaningful guidance, and a true understanding of what sustainable change looks like.</p>

    <p>Whether you're in Greater Manchester (including Ramsbottom, Bury, and surrounding areas) or working with me online from further afield, I bring care, skill, and a deep commitment to helping you move forward. This isnâ€™t just my job â€” itâ€™s my passion, my mission, and my purpose.</p>
