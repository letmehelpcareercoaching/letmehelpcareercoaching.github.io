    <h2>üí° Career Tip: Get Your Name Noticed</h2>

    <p>Getting your name known by a potential employer at least three times during your job application process can really boost your chances. Here‚Äôs how:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Research the employer.</strong> Find the job on their own website and apply directly there if possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Make contact before applying.</strong> Find a question to ask about the role and call the recruiter or hiring manager. Be friendly, ask your question, and make sure to give your name clearly.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow up after applying.</strong> Ask for an email address to confirm they‚Äôve received your application‚Äîor send your CV and cover letter directly to them, if appropriate.</li>
      <li><strong>Be proactive with communication.</strong> After sending your application, follow up once to check it has been received. Use names where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Make a follow-up call.</strong> After the application deadline, make a polite follow-up call to ask about the status of your application. Be positive and confident.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay professional throughout.</strong> Smile on the phone (people can hear it!). Make notes after each call and remember the names of those you speak with.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These small actions can help you stand out in a crowded job market. Employers appreciate polite, proactive candidates‚Äîso don't be afraid to get your name out there!</p>
