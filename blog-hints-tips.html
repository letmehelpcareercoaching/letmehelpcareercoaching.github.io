    <h2>Top Tips to Get Your Name Noticed by Employers</h2>
    <p>Getting your name known by a potential employer at least three times during your job application process can really boost your chances. Here’s how:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you find the job you want, apply directly on the employer’s website.</li>
      <li>Look for a question to ask about the role or company, then contact the recruitment person at the company to ask that question.</li>
      <li>When you make contact, be sure to give your name at that point.</li>
      <li>Ask for an email address if it’s appropriate so you can send your CV and cover letter directly.</li>
      <li>Send your application, and then check if it has been received.</li>
      <li>Make a follow-up call after the application deadline (usually 3 days after) to enquire about the status of your application.</li>
      <li>Throughout the process, be really positive and smile on the phone – they can hear it even though they can’t see you.</li>
      <li>Remember the name of each person you speak to, and make your own notes to keep track.</li>
    </ul>
