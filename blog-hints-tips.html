      `1. Research the employer. Find the job on their own website and apply directly there if possible.\n
2. Make contact before applying. Find a question to ask about the role and call the recruiter or hiring manager. Be friendly, ask your question, and make sure to give your name clearly.\n
3. Follow up after applying. Ask for an email address to confirm they‚Äôve received your application‚Äîor send your CV and cover letter directly to them, if appropriate.\n
4. Be proactive with communication. After sending your application, follow up once to check it has been received. Use names where possible.\n
5. Make a follow-up call. After the application deadline, make a polite follow-up call to ask about the status of your application. Be positive and confident.\n
6. Stay professional throughout. Smile on the phone (people can hear it!). Make notes after each call and remember the names of those you speak with.\n
\nThese small actions can help you stand out in a crowded job market. Employers appreciate polite, proactive candidates‚Äîso don't be afraid to get your name out there!`,

      `Following up on your application demonstrates your interest and professionalism. After the deadline, give it a few days, then call or email to check the status. Remember to:\n
- Be polite and positive.\n
- Mention your name and the job you applied for.\n
- Ask if there‚Äôs any additional information they need.\n
- Thank them for their time.\n
\nThis can help keep you top of mind and show your enthusiasm for the role.`
