    <div id="tip-content">
Getting your name known by a potential employer at least three times during your job application process can really boost your chances. Hereâ€™s how:

1. When you find a job you want, apply directly on their website.
2. Find a question to ask about the role.
3. Contact the recruitment person in the company to ask your question, and give your name at that point.
4. Ask if you can have an email address to confirm they received your application or to send your CV and cover letter directly (if appropriate).
5. Send your application.
6. Check if it has been received.
7. Make a follow-up call (usually 3 days after the deadline) to enquire about the status of your application.

Throughout, be positive, smile on the phone (they can hear it!), remember each personâ€™s name, and take your own notes.
