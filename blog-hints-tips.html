    <h2>Top Tips to Get Your Name Noticed by Employers</h2>
    <p>Getting your name known by a potential employer at least three times during your job application process can really boost your chances. Here’s how:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Find the job you want</strong> and apply directly on the employer’s website.</li>
      <li><strong>Look for a question to ask</strong> about the role or company, then contact the recruitment person at the company to ask that question.</li>
      <li><strong>Give your name</strong> when you make contact.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask for an email address</strong> if it’s appropriate so you can send your CV and cover letter directly.</li>
      <li><strong>Send your application, then check if it has been received.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Make a follow-up call after the application deadline</strong> (usually 3 days after) to enquire about the status of your application.</li>
      <li><strong>Be really positive and smile on the phone</strong> – they can hear it even though they can’t see you.</li>
      <li><strong>Remember the name of each person you speak to</strong>, and make your own notes to keep track.</li>
    </ol>
