    <h2>ðŸ’¡ Career Tips: Get Your Name Noticed</h2>

    <div id="tip-content">
      <p>Getting your name known by a potential employer at least three times during your job application process can really boost your chances. Hereâ€™s how:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Research the employer. Find the job on their own website and apply directly there if possible.</li>
        <li>Make contact before applying. Find a question to ask about the role and call the recruiter or hiring manager. Be friendly, ask your question, and make sure to give your name clearly.</li>
        <li>Follow up after applying. Ask for an email address to confirm theyâ€™ve received your applicationâ€”or send your CV and cover letter directly to them, if appropriate.</li>
        <li>Be proactive with communication. After sending your application, follow up once to check it has been received. Use names where possible.</li>
        <li>Make a follow-up call. After the application deadline, make a polite follow-up call to ask about the status of your application. Be positive and confident.</li>
        <li>Stay professional throughout. Smile on the phone (people can hear it!). Make notes after each call and remember the names of those you speak with.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These small actions can help you stand out in a crowded job market. Employers appreciate polite, proactive candidatesâ€”so don't be afraid to get your name out there!</p>
