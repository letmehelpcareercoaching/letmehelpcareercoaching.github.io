      `Getting your name known by a potential employer at least three times during your job application process can really boost your chances. Hereâ€™s how:\n
1. When you find a job you want, apply directly on their website.\n
2. Find a question to ask about the role.\n
3. Contact the recruitment person in the company to ask your question, and give your name at that point.\n
4. Ask if you can have an email address to confirm they received your application or to send your CV and cover letter directly (if appropriate).\n
5. Send your application.\n
6. Check if it has been received.\n
7. Make a follow-up call (usually 3 days after the deadline) to enquire about the status of your application.\n
\nThroughout, be positive, smile on the phone (they can hear it!), remember each personâ€™s name, and take your own notes.`,

      `Following up on your application demonstrates your interest and professionalism. After the deadline, give it a few days, then call or email to check the status. Remember to:\n
- Be polite and positive.\n
- Mention your name and the job you applied for.\n
- Ask if thereâ€™s any additional information they need.\n
- Thank them for their time.\n
\nThis can help keep you top of mind and show your enthusiasm for the role.`
